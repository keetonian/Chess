Setup Instructions:
Download Python 3 (we are using 3.5.1) from python.org and follow the instructions on the site to install it on your system.
Download Kivy 1.9.1 from kivy.org. Make sure to download the version for Python3. Follow the instructions on the site to install Kivy.app on your local machine.
Download PyCharm. The latest release should be good. https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/

Project setup:
Download the source code, and open the project in PyCharm.
We need to use Kivy in order to run UI elements, so lets set that up next.
	Go to PyCharm > Preferences. Select the Project Interpreter tab.
	Inside of this tab, you will see the version of python that you are currently using under the Project Interpreter space. Click on the settings button (gear icon) and select 'Create VirtualEnv'
	Name this virtual environment 'Kivy', check the check boxes if you feel like, and change the location to where you like. I left mine as the default location. Set Default Interpreter to your Python3 directory if you like, but you will be changing this soon.
	Hit ok.
	Change your project interpreter to 'Kivy'
	Click on the Settings (gear) button again. Click on 'More...'
	Click on 'Kivy' and select the 'edit' (pencil) option at the bottom of the screen. Change 'Interpreter path' to be /usr/local/bin/kivy
	Hit Ok several times, make sure that this environment is selected for this project, then get ready to go!
