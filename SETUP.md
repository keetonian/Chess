#####Project setup:
Clone the source code, and open the project in PyCharm. <br />
We need to use Kivy in order to run UI elements, so lets set that up next. <br />
Go to PyCharm > Preferences. Select the Project Interpreter tab under Project. <br />
Make sure that you are using Python 3.x and that PyCharm has detected your Kivy installation. <br />
Hit OK and exit.
